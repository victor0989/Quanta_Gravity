ASCII Diagram of Frequency Distortions and Gravitational Portals
Here’s a simplified ASCII representation of a 6D space-time distortion leading to a gravitational portal:

1. The central region (⟡⟡⟡⟡) represents the quantum-gravitational anomaly.

2. The outer layers (~~~) are wave-like distortions propagating outward.

3. The ∞ at the top and bottom represents a time inversion effect (suggesting a non-linear temporal loop).
