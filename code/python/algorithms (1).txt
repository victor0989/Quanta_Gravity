Algorithm(1)

Variables:

(1) min

(2) w

such that:

−ˆu⊺w +q√w⊺ w

1⊺w = 1,

|w − ¯ w|≤ζ,

w≥0,

Algorithm(2)

Variables:

(1) min

(2) w

such that:

w⊺ w

ˆu⊺w ≥¯rmin,

1⊺w = 1,

w≥0.

Algorithm(3)

The objective function in Eq. (3) has a nonlinear term q√w⊺ w, which we linearize by introducing a new scalar variable t and a new constraint t≥√w⊺ w. We obtain the equivalent optimization problem:

min x=(w;t)

[−ˆu;q]⊺(w;t)

such that:

1⊺w=1,

|wi−¯ wi|≤ζi,

wi≥0,

t²≥w⊺ w.

Our goal now is to write the constraints in Eq. (9) as second-order cone constraints. Given an m×n matrix M for which =M⊺M, the constraint on t can be expressed by introducing an m-dimensional variable η subject to the equality constraint η=Mw and the second-order cone constraint (t;η)∈Qm+1.

Variables:

y

such that:

b⊺y

A⊺y+s=c,

s∈Q.

We say that a pair (s;y) is dual feasible whenever A⊺y+s=c and s∈Q. For any point (x;y;s) with x,s∈Q, we define the duality gap as

μ(x,s):=1 r x⊺s=1 r (c⊺x−b⊺y),

The absolute-value constraints are handled by introducing a pair of n-dimensional variables φ and ρ, subject to equality constraints φ=ζ−(w−¯ w) and ρ=ζ+(w−¯ w). The absolute-value constraints are then imposed as positivity constraints φi≥0, ρi≥0, which we include as second-order cone constraints of dimension 1[49].

In summary, we may write the PO problem from Eq. (3) as the following SOCP that minimizes over the variable x=(w;φ;ρ;t;η)∈R3n+m+1:

min x [−ˆu;0;0;q;0]⊺(w;φ;ρ;t;η)=:c⊺x

such that:

(1) ⎛ 1⊺ 0⊺ 0⊺ 0 0⊺ I I 0 0 0 I 0 −I 0 0 M 0 0 0 −I ⎞ ⎠ ⎛ w φ ρ t η ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎛ 1 ¯ w+ζ ¯ w−ζ 0.
